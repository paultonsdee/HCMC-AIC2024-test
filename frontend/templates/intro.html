                        <li class="d-flex"><b>Description</b>:&nbsp;<p>This competition challenges participants to find videos containing pre-defined information, such as short clips or images. The goal is to locate these videos within a vast dataset of news video footage from Vietnamese television channels and newspapers. This complex task addresses the growing challenge of video search in the face of increasing video data volumes and frequent updates, highlighting the difficulty of identifying events within video content. Instead of seeking a fully automated solution, the competition encourages teams to develop user-friendly software applications that efficiently and accurately help users find the desired video content.</p></li>
