# Introduction to `db`


## Installation

The script for downloading pre-defined dataset is scripted in `download_file.sh`. The code is run well in most cases. 
However, in case the dataset is not able to be downloaded due to high level of throughput, etc. please refers the dataset from this [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=18Fx1dmi_OJVdGE5ObU8NR08z7DNjCd9n). After download the dataset and extract it, please put it into the `db` directory.
